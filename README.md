# calculator_js

As the title implies, this is a calculator I made using nothing but Vanilla Javascript and some nice and elegant CSS.

Features : 
 - All mathematicals operations a calculator offers. Trigonometry, Exponentiation etc [...]
 
 
 Bugs to fix / Improvements I plan to implement : 
 
 - A wider screen to display the squareroot symbol for example. 
 - Overall work on providing a better user experience, as it can be confusing to use the app right now. 
 - How many numbers after the decimal points window on the screen.
